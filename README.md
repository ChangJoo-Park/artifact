# risk: the fast text based requirements tracking tool

risk is a fast text-based requirements tracking tool that tips it's hat
to risk driven testing in order to allow better analsyis of coverage
in both implementation and testing.

risk strongly believes in linking requirements to risks and design specifications,
and link those to test cases and implementation. It aims to provide a simple
to use interface that can be tracked through revision control and viewed
using a web browser.

risk is written entirely in rust
