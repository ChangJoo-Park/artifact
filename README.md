# rsk: the requirements tracking tool made for developers
**rsk** is a requirements tracking tool made for developers.

The primary goal of **rsk** is to provide a clean and simple text based
interface for requirements tracking.

**rsk**, as the name implies, is different from many other requirements
tracking tools. In addition to tracking the progress of design specifications
and their associated tests, **rsk** supports tracking the *risks* related 
to any requirement. Once a team member identifies risks associated with a 
requirement, the testing (whether end-to-end or unit) of those risks can be 
tracked so that developers can get a sense of when they are "done" testing.

**rsk** provides a simple inteface by which the developer can view their progress 
through the command line, as well as providing their users/manager/team 
easy to navitage html.

**rsk** is designed to scale to projects of any size, from a 300 line open
source library with minimal requirements all the way to production 
level software with extensive requirements. 

It is believed that by providing a comprehensive tool for accomplishing this 
task, writing of requirements and detailed design can become as second nature 
to developers as writing unit tests and using revision control has become.
