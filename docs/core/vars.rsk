variables **shall** be instantiated when settings are loaded and must be resolved
in two steps:
 1. default globals within the variables, which depend on the path information
 2. iterative resolution of variables, which may require more than one pass (due to
      embedded variables)
 3. actually replacing the variables in artifact text fields
