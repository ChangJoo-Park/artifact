Type checking and validity, and failing on invalid data is essential
for the functionality of rsk and the reporting of errors to the user.

loading is a **critical** component. There is a **low** likelyhood that
this issue will be a **boulder**

The **toml** library used is currently not stable. To prevent user impact
to changes in the toml library (or at least able to inform users of breaking
changes), extensive unit testsing must be in place that checks for
breaking changes.

the stability of the format is a **critical** component as it could directly
impact users. There is a **low** likelyhood that this issue will be an **avalanche**
