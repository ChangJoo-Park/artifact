The following fields **will** have variables applied:
- settings fields:
    - paths: **only** the default globals will be interpreted, see
        REQ-core-vars-globals-[cwd, repo]
- artifact fields:
    - text: useful for documenting paths, links, etc.
    - refs: not recommended for artifact strings, but supported
    - loc: one of the primary purposes of variables is to be able
        to do something like `loc = "LOC-foo: {core}/foo.rs"`
        so it is definitely supported! It is recommended (but not
        enforced) to not use variables before the ":" token.

The following **will not** have variables applied:
- settings fields:
    - disabled: not a string
    - repo_names: not useful for it's purpose
- artifact fields:
    - key fields: you cannot use vars in the key fields (i.e. `[key]`)
        as these are processed before variables are ever processed
        and it would make it more difficult to read your documents.
    - partof: for much the same reason, you cannot use them in partof.
        partof already provides useful ways to abbreviate artifact names,
        having variables as well would only add to the confusion.

variables **shall** be loaded in the following manner:
- default globals will always be loaded on a per-file basis
    and their text will be interpreted for the defaults
    immediately.
- global variables will be interpreted at a later time,
    after all artifacts have been loaded
- global variabes can use eachother in their definition,
    as long as the definition isn't recursive
