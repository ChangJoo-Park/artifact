The **toml** library used is currently not stable. To prevent user impact
to changes in the toml library (or at least able to inform users of breaking
changes), extensive unit testsing must be in place that checks for
breaking changes.

the stability of the format is a **critical** component as it could directly
impact users. There is a **low** likelyhood that this issue will be an **avalanche**

# weight = 15

loading is a **critical** component. Without proper care and testing, there is a
**low** likelyhood that requirements could try to load infinitely causing a
**rock** of a problem.

There are several safeguards:
- directories that are loaded are stored. If loading is attempted again,
    they will not be loaded.
- testing can create situations that may cause recursive loads and validate that they
    don't.
- recusrive directory loads should always execute completely before the next path
    is processed

This details the high level loading proceedure of rsk

The loading of the project files shall occur in 5 stages:
 1. loading and validation of raw data from all settings.paths recursively
 2. load and validate variables
 3. resolving of variables in text fields
 4. auto-creation of missing prefix artifacts
 5. linking of artifacts (parts, partof)

The only locations where critical failure is possible are in steps 1 and 2.

Critical failure shall occur if:
- invalid toml
- artifact errors (invalid name, extra attr, invalid attr type, etc)
- invalid partof string (artifact names)
- invalid path

Failures in further steps will simply cause warnings and will display on the
ui as missing links or None completion (etc)

Loading and basic validation of raw text **shall** be accomplished mostly by

settings.paths shall be resolved after a directory is fully loaded, as
the repos won't be known until then.

HashMap<Path, Path> where the key is the cwd and the value is
the calculated repo
