location finding is a fundamentally a simple problem: recursively search through
the directories given by settings.code_paths (excluding settings.exclude_code_paths)
and store the ArtNames that are found and where they were found (path, line, col)
in a Loc object.

Once they are found, attaching them is a simple lookup.

> The process is very similar to SPC-load-raw
