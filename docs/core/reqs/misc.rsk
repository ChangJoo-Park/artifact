[REQ-core-load-error-wait]
text = '''
During loading, as many errors **should** be displayed as possible before crashing.

These errors **should** be as descriptve as possible, including information like:
 - what variable is in error
 - what variable **caused** the error
 - the pprint of the variables in question
 - the location where the variables are defined

This takes a lesson from compilers as seeing all the errors can significantly help
the user debug their problems
