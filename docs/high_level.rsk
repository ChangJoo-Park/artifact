# Core: high level requirements related to the core module

[REQ-2-ftype]
text = '''
All rsk configuration and artifacts **will** be stored in files using
[toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format with the `.rsk` extention.

Artifacts **will** be items with keys denoted by their prefix (REQ, RSK, etc.).
In addition, there **shall** be the following special items:

- `settings`: stores various configuration settings of the whole project
- `globals`: stores global variables that can be used in any text field
'''

[REQ-2-load]
text = '''
There **shall** be settings in .rsk files that detail which directories to load.

**rsk** shall recursively load all directories given to it in the `artifact_paths` setting.
**recursively** is defined as "load until there is a directory with no `.rsk` files".

Example:
**rsk** will try to load /foo and /foo/src but will not try to load
/foo/src/bar as there were no `.rsk` files in /foo/src
```
/foo/foo.rsk
/foo/src/foo.rs
/foo/src/bar/bar.rs
```

This allows nesting of projects without increasing time time it takes
to load projects dramatically.

weight = 25

The **toml** library used is currently not stable. To prevent user impact
to changes in the toml library (or at least able to inform users of breaking
changes), extensive unit testsing must be in place that checks for
breaking changes.

the stability of the format is a **critical** component as it could directly
impact users. There is a **low** likelyhood that this issue will be an **avalanche**

Type checking and validity, and failing on invalid data is essential

[RSK-2-load-loop]
text = '''
# weight = 15

loading is a **critical** component. Without proper care and testing, there is a
**low** likelyhood that requirements could try to load infinitely causing a
**rock** of a problem.

There are several safeguards:
- directories that are loaded are stored. If loading is attempted again,
    they will not be loaded.
- testing can create situations that may cause recursive loads and validate that they
    don't.
- recusrive directory loads should always execute completely before the next path
    is processed

[REQ-2-settings]
partof = "REQ-1-variables"

Each .rsk file **will** be able to detail various settings. Any .rsk file
can detail these settings (there is no special "config file")

The "initial .rsk file" **shall** be able to be specified in the command
line and will default to `{cwd}/.rsk/settings.rsk`

The settings are:
 - `artifact_paths`: path to a directory containing more .rsk files
 - `code_paths`: path to directory containing code which implements
      artifacts (see `loc`)
 - `exclude_code_paths`: code paths to exclude

[REQ-2-artifact]
partof = "REQ-1-artifact"
text = '''
rsk **shall** load artifacts from .rsk files in a "flat style" -- i.e. artifacts
can be defined anywhere, the path to the file is not important.

Strict naming **will** be enforced to follow REQ-1-artifacts, where the prefix
**will** be used to specify the type. i.e. `REQ-foo` means `foo` of type `REQ`

All artifact names **will** be composed of only the characters in the set:
`a-zA-Z0-9_-`

In other words, that is all alpha-numeric characters as well as "_" and "-".

Also:
- case will be ignored ("a" == "A")
- whitespace will be ignored ("a b" == "ab")
- other characters will cause an error to be raised
- "-" has a special meaning as defined in REQ-core-links-prefix
- the artifact name cannot end with "-"
- the artifact name must begin with a valid artifact (REQ, SPC, RSK, or TST)
'''

[REQ-2-artifact-attrs]
text = '''
All artifacts **will** have the following attributes that the user can define:
- disabled: whether the artifact should be skipped during analysis
- text: description of the artifact
- partof: a string containing artifact names which the artifact is a part of
'''

[REQ-2-names]
text = '''
Artifact names **shall** follow the following spec for specifying multiple artifacts
- `[]` **will** denote a set of artifacts related to the prevoius characters
- `,` **will** denote separate artifact groups

# Example:
Both of these are the same set of artifacts:
- `bar-d[1, 2, 3]`
- `bar-d1, bar-d2, bar-d3`

Note: spaces ` ` are always ignored

# invalid inputs
- `,` and `:` characters are **only** permitted inside of brackets
- after a closing bracket `]`, **only** the `,` or `]` character is permitted
    - i.e. `REQ-[foo, bar]-baz` is invalid
- it is an error for a `LOC` artifact to be in `partof` (use `loc`)

# valid inputs
Some interesting valid use cases are:
- `REQ-[foo, bar-[1, 2, 3, 6], baz]` evaluates to `REQ-foo, REQ-bar-[1, 2, 3, 6], REQ-baz`
    which evaluates to `REQ-foo, REQ-bar-1, REQ-bar-2, REQ-bar-3, REQ-bar-6, REQ-baz`

The reasons for these rules are:
- without the avility to do ranges or re-use a prefix, it can be very annoying to
    list the requirements in an easy to understand way
- however, the use cases for wanting to do something like [a,b]-[1,2,3] are poor.
    The names and purpose of sub-categories should rarely (if ever) be
    connected, and trying to maintain structures like that would likely cause
    the developer more harm than good.
- the parser is much easier to implement, and it is easier to see "under the hood"
    at what the parser is actually doing if it only uses simple recursion rather than
    having to go backwards in the parsing.

[REQ-2-loc]

> Note: `ART` is either `SPC` or `TST`

If a valid artifact is implemented at a LOC, then it **will** be considered "done" by
the coverage analysis
