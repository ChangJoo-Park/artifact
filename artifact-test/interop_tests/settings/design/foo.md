## SPC-foo
This is the spec for foo, it does lots of foo.

It is some foo subparts:
- [[.no]]: not done
- [[.yes]]: done


## SPC-foo_done
```yaml art
done: this is done

partof:
- REQ-foo
- SPC-foo
```
This is done and is weird?


## TST-foo
Partially done foo test with some subparts

- [[.no1]]
- [[.no2]]
- [[.yes1]]
- [[.yes2]]
- [[.yes3]]
- [[.yes4]]
